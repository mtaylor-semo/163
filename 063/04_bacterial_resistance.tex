\subsection*{Natural selection in bacteria}

All species can evolve through the process of natural selection, including bacteria. Modern bacteria are frequently exposed to chemical agents, such as antibiotic drugs and antimicrobial soaps, as humans attempt to control bacterial disease and contamination. Many bacteria have evolved resistance to common agents intended to control bacteria. For example, about 94\% of the different strains of \textit{Staphylococcus aureus}, a common source of staph infections, were killed by penicillin when the drug was introduced in the early 1940s. In less than a decade, only 50\% of strains were susceptible. Within another decade, severe outbreaks of \textit{S. aureus} in hospitals were common (Livermore 2000). \textit{Staphylococcus aureus} and other bacteria evolved resistance to penicillin through natural selection. As bacteria were exposed to penicillin, many individuals were killed but not all. Surviving individuals were still able to reproduce so they had higher relative fitness. As the survivors reproduced, their offspring inherited resistance to penicillin. 

Imagine you are infected by just one cell of a harmful bacterium. Bacteria are capable of dividing (reproducing) every 20 minutes. Each division produces two cells from one parent cell. In 10 hours, the total number of bacteria from 30 divisions would be $2^{30} = 1,073,741,824,$ more than one billion cells. (No wonder illness seems to set in so quickly.) Now that you are feeling poorly, you take an antibiotic labeled as 99.9\% effective. The antibiotic might kill most cells but as many as 1,073,741 cells (0.01\% of 1,073,741,824 cells) might not killed by the antibiotic. \emph{Each} of those one million cells could go on to produce another one billion cells within 24 hours (the antibiotic can slow the growth of resistant bacteria), each with some resistance to the antibiotic. The problem is magnified because some people take antibiotics only until they feel better instead of the full time prescribed. An incomplete dose allows even more resistant bacterial cells to survive that might have been killed if the full dose had been taken. 

For this lab, you will expose a harmless soil bacterium, \textit{Bacillus cereus,} to different concentrations of Triclosan, an antimicrobial drug that was once used in hand soaps at concentrations of 0.1–0.4\%. You will test the ability of four concentrations of Triclosan (0.1\%, 0.3\%, 0.5\%, and 0.7\%) to inhibit growth of \textit{B. cereus.} You will grow the bacterium on agar plates. You will place a paper disk soaked with Triclosan in the center of the agar plate. The drug will seep into the agar, potentially inhibiting the growth of the bacteria around the disk. The inhibiting effect will decrease farther away from the disk so some bacteria will be able to survive if they are far enough away. You will measure the diameter of the zone of inhibition to determine the inhibitory effect of the drug. The Triclosan is dissolved in 50\% ethanol so you will include a control of 50\% ethanol without the drug.

\begin{questions}

\question \label{ques:hypothesis}
Write a hypothesis. How do you think different concentrations will affect the growth of \textit{B. cereus?}

%\vspace*{3\baselineskip}
\newpage

\question
Turn your hypothesis is a prediction. Remember that your prediction should predict the results of the experiment that would support your hypothesis. 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

\subsubsection*{Materials}

Everyone at your table will work as one group. Each table has the following items. Check to be sure each item is present before you begin. If you are missing an item, notify your instructor immediately.

\begin{itemize}

	\item Five petri plates with LB agar.
	
	\item One test tube culture of \textit{Bacillus cereus.}
	
	\item Four small jars of Triclosan at concentrations of 0.1\%, 0.3\%, 0.5\% and 0.7\%, dissolved in 50\% ethanol.
	
	\item One small jar with 50\% ethanol. This is a control.

	\item Glass petri dish of paper disks.
	
	\item Forceps.
	
	\item One biohazard bag.
	
	\item Sterile swabs.
	
	\item A marker for labeling.
	
	\item Non-latex gloves (on the back counter).
	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Procedure}

	\begin{enumerate}
	
		\item Put on a pair of gloves. Decide on a catchy but easy to remember name for your group.  
			
		\item Label the \emph{bottoms} of five petri plates with your catchy group name and your lab section number. \emph{Write the information near one edge so it will not obstruct your ability to take measurements next week.} Your instructor will tell you your section number.
		
		\item Label the \emph{top} of each petri plate with either C, 0.1\%, 0.3\%, 0.5\%, or 0.7\%, for the control and each of the four Triclosan concentrations. 
		
		\item \label{swab_first} Remove one sterile swab from the wrapper. 
		
		\item Remove the cap from the test tube culture of \textit{B. cereus.} Dip the cotton tip into liquid and remove. Place the cap back on the tube. Do \emph{not} dip the swab back into the culture.
		
		\item Carefully lift the lid off the petri plate enough to reach the entire surface of the agar with the swab.
		
		\item Swab the surface of the entire surface of the agar. Use gentle sweeping strokes to cover the entire surface. Rotate the plate 90° and swab again to cover the entire surface with bacteria. Do \emph{not} dip the swab back into the culture.
		
		{\centering\includegraphics[height=1in]{petri_plate_swab}\par
		}
		
		\item \label{swab_last} Close the lid and place the swab into the provided biohazard bag.
		
		\item Repeat steps~\ref{swab_first}–\ref{swab_last} for the other four petri plates. \emph{Use one new swab per plate.}
		
		\item \label{disk_first} Use sterile forceps to carefully remove one sterile disk from the glass petri dish. Dip the disk into the the microcentrifuge tube labeled C for one second and remove. This is control solution.
		
		\item \label{disk_last} Carefully lift the lid from the petri dish labeled C. Carefully lay the wet disk in the center of the petri plate. Place the lid back on the plate.

%		{\centering\includegraphics[height=1in]{petri_plate_disks}\par
%		}

		\item Repeat steps~\ref{disk_first}–\ref{disk_last} for each of the four concentrations of Triclosan.
		
		\item Place your petri plates in a stack \emph{upside down} on the counter at the back of the room.
		
	\end{enumerate}

The bacteria will be allowed to grow at room temperature for 24–48 hours. Your instructor will move the plates to a refrigerator to inhibit continued bacterial growth until you collect your data in lab next week.

\subsubsection*{Data collection}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Find your petri plates on the back counter and bring them to your table.
	
	\item Each plate should have, starting from the center, a clear zone of inhibition around the disk where no bacterial colonies are growing, a “halo” with scattered bacterial colonies growing, and then a solid bacterial “lawn,” as shown in the figure below.
	
		{\centering\includegraphics[height=1.25in]{petri_plate_results}\par
		}

	\item Place the plates on your table with the top side down to take measurements. \emph{Do not open the plates to take measurements.}
	
	\item Measure the diameter in centimeters of the zone of inhibition with the ruler (horizontal line in the figure below). You will have to estimate the boundary between the zone of inhibition and the halo. Record the measurement in the table below. Measure the diameter of the halo (vertical line). Record the measurement in the table. You do have to hold the ruler at the same angles as indicated in the figure. Do this for all five plates.

		{\centering\includegraphics[height=1.25in]{petri_plate_measure}\par
		}

	\item After you have your measurements, return your plates in a stack to the back counter where you got them from.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Formal lab report: natural selection in bacteria (30 points)}

Each student is responsible for writing their own lab report based on
the experiment you ran in your group, and on the data collected as a
class. Your report \emph{must be typed (double-spaced) and printed} to
turn in \emph{at the beginning of lab next week.}  

A lab report is written in narrative form and in past tense—you are
explaining to the reader your hypothesis, how you tested it, and the
results from the experiment. Each lab report section should be written
in paragraph form, \emph{no bulleted lists or orphan sentences!} Keep in
mind that a paragraph has at least three sentences, each paragraph should
discuss one major point or idea, and all sentences in the paragraph
should provide support to the first sentence (your topic sentence).

Your report must include the information described below, divided into the
sections as listed. Include the section headings in your lab report in the order listed. You must 
include all information listed in each section to earn full credit. 
Use this handout to guide you as you write.

\subsection*{Lab report sections}

\subsubsection*{Introduction (1 paragraph)} 

This section should begin with general observations made regarding
bacteria and anti-microbial resistance that motivated your experiment.
Next, state your hypothesis (you developed this as a group in question~\ref{ques:hypothesis}).
From your hypothesis, make clear predictions in if/then form. Review your handouts from
the first week on the scientific method.

\subsubsection*{Methods (2 paragraphs)} 

This section should be written in narrative form and in past tense. Do
not make a list of materials. You will mention the materials you used
throughout this section as relevant. \emph{This is not like writing a
recipe, you are not providing instructions for your reader}. Rather, you
are explaining to the reader how you set up the experiment and collected
your data.

As you write, consider which aspects are important to report to allow
the reader to understand how you set up your experiment. For example, it
is not necessary to include step A from the procedure (creating a catchy
name for your group), because this step is not necessary to repeat the
experiment. Likewise, ``remove the cap,'' ``put on a pair of
gloves,'' ``remove swab from wrapper,'' and ``lift the lid off of the petri
dish'' are also unnecessary to include. In the methods, you would simply
write something like, ``We dipped a sterile swab into the test culture
tube of \emph{B. cereus} and swabbed the entire surface of the agar.''
Notice how this simple statement combined steps \ref{swab_first}–\ref{swab_last} of your procedure.

The second paragraph should explain how you
collected your data. This section must be written in \emph{past tense} because you have
already completed the experiment and data collection. No credit will be
awarded for methods sections written in list or bullet form.

\subsubsection*{Results (1 paragraph)}

The results section will have \emph{two parts}. First, you will complete
Table~1 and Figure~1 from this handout \emph{using class data.} You must
write a suitable legend (caption) for the table \emph{and} the figure on
that sheet and staple it to your lab report. Table and figure legends
should provide all the necessary information for a reader to understand
the data without searching through the rest of your lab report.

The second part of this section is describing your results in narrative
form. Describe the overall trend in the class data for the size of the zone of inhibition and halo 
relative to the different treatment groups. \emph{Use metric
units to report your results.} \emph{Do not} list mean values in this section; rather, refer to
Table~1 and Figure~1 in the text when you are describing mean values or
the overall trend. For example, ``The zone of inhibition decreased in
size between 0.1\% and 0.5\% Triclosan (Figure 1).'' \emph{Avoid
providing any explanation or interpretation} of your results; this
section is only used to present the data collected in a brief and
descriptive format. You explain and interpret your results in the discussion section.

\emph{Remove the completed final page from this handout and attach it to your lab report.}

\subsubsection*{Discussion (2 paragraphs)} 

In this section, you summarize and interpret your results. Use what
was discussed in class as well as this handout to guide
your Discussion. But, \emph{do not} directly copy from the material provided.
You must address the following questions in narrative form, \emph{in your own words,} with two
paragraphs.

Was your hypothesis supported by your results? Explain why or why not. 
The results should agree with your prediction for your hypothesis to be supported. 

Why was a halo present? Was the halo among plates with different
concentrations of Triclosan? Or, did the relative size of the halo vary
with concentration? Why? How do your findings tie into the
process of natural selection?

Address these questions as necessary: Did anything go wrong during your
experiment? Did you get any unexpected results? Can you hypothesize
why that may have happened? What might you do differently next time?

Finally, place your experiment in the broader context of natural
selection as related to antimicrobial resistance in one or two
sentences. In other words, why might your results be important to the
scientific community?
