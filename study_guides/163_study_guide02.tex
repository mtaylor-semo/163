\section*{Allele and genotype frequencies; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium}

We\marginnote{\textbf{Read:} pgs. 257 (diploid and haploid), 274~(useful 
genetic vocabulary), 490--493 (gene pools through Hardy-Weinberg).} 
discussed the calculation of allele and genotype frequencies, and
introduced the two Hardy-Weinberg equations that model the evolutionary
change of allele and genotype frequencies. One equation is used to 
calculate allele frequencies. The other equation is used to calculate 
genotype frequencies. You must remember which equation is used to 
calculate allele frequencies and which is used to calculate genotype 
frequencies. This is the most common mistake made when students 
attempt to solve Hardy-Weinberg problems so work hard at learning
and applying these two equations.

\section*{Allele Frequency}

The equation for calculating \emph{allele frequencies} is 
\begin{equation*}
p+q = 1,
\end{equation*}

where $p$ is the frequency of allele 1, and $q$ is the frequency of allele 2. In class, we will use only two alleles for a single locus\marginnote{In reality, most genes have many more than two alleles. The calculation of allele frequencies is the same, but with a variable added for each allele. If a gene has three alleles, for example, the equation would be expanded to $p+q+r=1$}, such as $T_1$ and $T_2$.  Two variables ($p$ and $q$) are needed to represent two alleles.  Why not use $T$ and $t$ instead of $p$ and $q$?  The vast majority of genes have names longer than a single letter, such as \emph{sonic hedgehog} (\emph{shh}) or \emph{bone morphogenetic protein 4} (\emph{bmp4}). Writing equations with long gene names would get confusing. Variable names like $p$ and $q$ are easier to understand.  In addition, we do not have to concern ourselves with dominant, recessive, or codominant alleles, or other types of gene expression. 

\begin{marginfigure}[0.5in]

\end{marginfigure}

I use frequency and proportion interchangeably. They mean the same thing.  Given all alleles in a population, the proportion that is \emph{one particular allele} is the frequency of that allele.  The frequency of an allele represents how common the allele is in the population, expressed as a decimal fraction. For example, if a population has 124 total alleles and 31 of them are the $p$ allele, then $p= 34/124 = 0.25$.  This means that 25\% of the alleles in the population are the $p$ allele.  The remaining proportion (75\%) are the $q$ allele.

\section*{Genotype Frequency}

\begin{marginfigure}[0.35in]
	\includegraphics[page=9]{\lecturefile}
\end{marginfigure}

Diploid organisms have two alleles for each gene locus. The combination of alleles is the genotype for the gene locus. The genotype might be homozygous (two copies of the same allele) or heterozygous (two different alleles).  Given two alleles, there are three possible genotypes. Set aside $p$ and $q$ for the moment but consider two alleles, $T_1$ and $T_2$. The three possible genotypes are $T_1T_1$, $T_2T_2$, and $T_1T_2$.  The \emph{genotype frequencies} in a population is calculated by

\begin{equation*}
p^2 + 2pq+q^2=1,
\end{equation*}
where $p^2$ is the frequency of one homozygous genotype (e.g., $T_1T_1$), $q^2$ is the frequency of the other homozygous genotype $(T_2T_2)$, and $2pq$ is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype $(T_1T_2)$.  Three terms are needed to represent the three possible genotypes. 

How are the two Hardy-Weinberg equations related?  Consider a large, randomly mating population with two alleles.  The alleles are present at frequencies $p$ and $q$.  The proportion of each genotype produced in the next generation is calculated by multiplying $p+q$ times itself\marginnote{Think of individuals \emph{multiplying} (mating) in a population.},
\begin{equation*}
(p+q)^2=
(p+q)(p+q) =
p^2 + pq + qp + q^2 =
p^2 + 2pq + q^2.
\end{equation*}

\section*{Concepts}

You should \emph{write} clear and concise answers to each question in the Concepts section.  Remember to ``think horizontally'' and to ``connect the dots.'' 

\begin{enumerate}

	\item When you think about genotypes, remember that the
	definition varies slightly depending on how you use it. In
	general, the genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism. 
	But, the genotype of a \emph{diploid}%
	\marginnote{\emph{Diploid} refers to organisms that have two 
	copies of each chromosome and so have two alleles for each 
	gene. For some diploid species, the males may be haploid, 
	meaning the males have only one allele for each gene. A few 
	species are haploid (one allele), tetraploid (4 alleles) or 
	octoploid (8 alleles) but these species are relatively uncommon.} 
	individual can refer to one gene (e.g., it is $A_1A_2$), 
	for multiple genes (e.g., 
	$A_1A_2B_2B_2$, $A_1A_2B_2B_2C_1C_1$), or for all genes (the genome).

	\item Know the two formulas that, together, are the Hardy-Weinberg Equations.

	\item What do the Hardy-Weinberg equations demonstrate about allele frequencies in a population?

	\item What is the difference between a heterozygote and a homozygote?

	\item What is the difference between alleles and genotypes?  What is the difference between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies?

	\item Which of the two Hardy-Weinberg formulas represent the frequencies of two alleles (at one gene locus) in a population?  Which of the two Hardy-Weinberg formulas represent the frequencies of the three possible genotypes (at one gene locus) in a population?

	\item Be able to use the Hardy-Weinberg equations to derive allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population.  Be able to derive allele frequencies based on numbers on different phenotypes and genotypes in a population (like the flower example we worked in class). 

	\item What does it mean\marginnote{Later, you will learn the evolutionary processes that cause populations to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.} to say that a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

	\item Organisms differ because they have different sets of alleles, not different genes.%
	\marginnote{There are differences in gene expression but that 
		is beyond the scope of this lecture.}
	Human and mice have the same genes but different alleles for 
	those genes.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\noindent A population of 100 individuals in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

that are $A_2A_2$. Calculate the allele and genotype frequencies
