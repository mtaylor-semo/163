\section*{Microevolutionary processes other than natural selection}

We\marginnote{\textbf{Read:} pages 486--497, including the small box on the lower left of page 492 and complete the scientific skills exercise on page 493,  but skip Natural Selection sections for now.} covered ways other than natural selection that populations evolve, including gene flow, mutation, non-random mating, and genetic drift. We introduced the concept of microevolution.

\section*{Concepts}

You should \emph{write} clear and concise answers to each question in the Concepts section.  
Remember to ``think horizontally'' and to ``connect the dots.'' 

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Be sure you have a basic understanding of allele frequency.%
	\marginnote{Microevolution is change of allele frequencies in a population over time.}
	Frequency refers to how common something is. An allele that is common in a population has a high frequency. An allele that is rare in a population has a low frequency.
	
	\item Explain the relation between the definition of ``evolution'' 
	and “microevolution.” How are they the same or different? 

	\item According to the small box on page 486, what are the 
	five evolutionary processes that cause allele frequencies in 
	a population to change? Which four did we cover in this lecture? 
	Explain how each of these four causes allele frequencies to change.
	
%	\begin{marginfigure}[0.5in]
%		\includegraphics[page=3]{\lecturefile}
%	\end{marginfigure}

	\textsc{Note:} You must remember that these processes cause 
	populations to evolve. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumes 
	that these five processes are \emph{not} occurring in a population. 
	If one or more of these processes are occurring, then the 
	population will probably not be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
	
	\item Explain how mutations change allele frequencies. Assume that
	the mutation creates a brand new allele that did not before exist
	in the population. For an easy way to think about this, consider 
	$p = 1.0$ and $q = 0.0$. That is, the population has only a single
	allele, and then a mutation occurs. How will the new allele affect 
	$p$ and $q$?
	
	\item What are neutral mutations? That is, why are they called 
	neutral? Are all mutations neutral? Can mutations be detrimental
	(bad for the organism) or beneficial (good for the organism)? 
	Explain.
	
	\item If heterozygosity is the proportion of heterozygotes in a 
	population, then what is homozygosity?	
	
	\item Explain the relationship between gene flow and the movement
	of individuals between populations. Explain how gene flow can change
	allele frequencies in a population. 
	
	\item Does gene flow always increase heterozygosity in a population? Explain.
	
	\item Explain%
	\marginnote{Although non-random mating can increase heterozygosity
	for some genes, overall heterozygosity for most genes decreases.}
	how non-random mating changes allele frequency in a population.
	 
	\item How does non-random mating decrease heterozygosity?%
	\marginnote{Heterozygosity and homozygosity must add up to 1. 
	If an individual is not heterozygous, it must be heterozygous.}
	If heterozygosity is decreasing, what must be increasing?
	
	\item Is genetic drift present in all populations?%
	\marginnote{Remember the assumption of infinite population size.}%
	 Why? Is genetic drift more pronounced in large populations or 
	 small populations?  Why?

	\item Compare and contrast bottleneck and founder effects.%
	\marginnote{It is important to remember that genetic drift is 
	any change in allele frequencies due to random events. Bottleneck 
	and founder effects both involve a random selection of individuals 
	and therefore a random selection of alleles.}  
	How are they similar?  How do they differ?  Explain why they are types of genetic drift.
		
	\item Which two processes (other than natural selection) decrease 
	heterozygosity? Is this a good thing or a bad thing for the 
	population? Why?
	
	\item Which two processes (other than natural selection) tend 
	to increase heterozygosity? Is this a good thing or a bad thing 
	for the population? Why?

\section*{Example exam questions}

These are examples only and not exhaustive. One or more of these questions may or may not appear on the exam.

\bigskip

\noindent \rule{1in}{0.4pt} Inbreeding is an example of this cause of microevolution.

\bigskip

\noindent True\hspace{1em}False\hspace{1em} Gene flow is enough to stop the effects of genetic drift in  \\
\noindent \phantom{True\hspace{1em}False\hspace{1em}}  a large population.

\bigskip

\noindent True\hspace{1em}False\hspace{1em} If $p=0.4$, then heterozygosity is $0.48$.

\bigskip

\noindent True\hspace{1em}False\hspace{1em} Inbreeding always causes a
decrease in homozygosity.

\bigskip
\noindent Prairie chickens are endangered grassland birds. In Illinois, 
grasslands used to cover most of the state but farming and growth of 
cities changed the habitat over a fairly short period of time. Now, 
less than 1\% of the grasslands remain. A study showed that most genes 
had far fewer alleles than historic populations. The loss of genetic 
variation is most likely due to

\smallskip

\noindent \textsc{a}. the small population size causing random fluctuation of allele frequencies.\\
\noindent \textsc{b}. a genetic bottleneck caused by the loss of habitat. \\
\noindent \textsc{c}. a founder event caused by individuals moving to the remaining grasslands. \\
\noindent \textsc{d}. directional selection that favored survivorship in small habitats. \\
\noindent \textsc{e}. balancing selection, which maintains genetic variation in small populations.
